# python_arduino_voice_interface
This code creates an interface between python code (running on a PC) and arduino code (running on arduino Uno). The arduino Uno is connected to PC via USB cable. On the arduino uno side, i have connected an LED on pin13 which am controlling via voice. This repo has both the code running on PC and arduino Uno. This is still work in progress. My ultimate aim is to be able to control a robotic arm that i have designed via voice. 

Please noe that the computer running the python code uses Ubuntu 16.0.4. This means that this code will not work for those using windows. If you want to use it on a computer using windows operating system, then you have to alter the following piece of code (ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM0', 115200, timeout = 1)) found in the def light_on and def light-off functions to reflect the serial port you are using on a windows pc. For a windows pc, the serial port to which arduino is connected is usually "COM#" were # is a number such as 11. Please confirm the port by running device manager.
