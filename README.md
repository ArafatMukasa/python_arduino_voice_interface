# python_arduino_voice_interface
This code creates an interface between python code (running on a PC) and arduino code (running on arduino Uno). The arduino Uno is connected to PC via USB cable. On the arduino uno side, i have connected an LED on pin13 which am controlling via voice. This repo has both the code running on PC and arduino Uno. This is still work in progress. My ultimate aim is to be able to control a robotic arm that i have designed via voice.
